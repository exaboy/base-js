    <p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I find your lack of faith disturbing. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</p>
    <p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
    <p>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
    <p>Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. What!? What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide.</p>
    <p>But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.</p>
    <p>What?! What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide. Red Five standing by. I find your lack of faith disturbing. What?!</p>
    <p>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. Ye-ha! Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>
    <p>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</p>
    <p>Don't underestimate the Force. What?! Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</p>
    <p>Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.</p>
